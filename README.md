# Fireflies!

## Dependencies
- [Fabric Api](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) (REQUIRED)
- [LambDynamicLights](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights) (OPTIONAL, makes the fireflies emit light when glowing)

## What does this mod add?
### Like the name implies, this mod adds firefly entities like Mojang was supposed to. The firefly entities spawn in forests (not snowy), plains, and beaches. Similar to how real fireflies glow, the firefly entities glow as well.
### In addition, the fireflies can be caught in glass bottles!

## Compatibility
- Sodium (Firefly particles get added to the particle screen)
- LambDynamicLights (Fireflies and caught fireflies emit light)
- Just about everything else
