# FIREFLIES!
### What does this mod add?
This mod adds fireflies to the game as they were\
intended by mojang! What's that mean?

## FEATURES:
- Frogs eat fireflies
- Fireflies spawn at night in swamps and other biomes
- Fireflies emit light (only if [lambdynamiclights](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights) is installed)
- Fireflies can be caught in bottles!

### Additional features
Caught fireflies can be smelted to retrieve their photocyte,\
which can be crafted with a glow ink sac to make glow powder.\
Glow powder can be brewed into a glow potion!

### Compatibility
This mod should be compatible with just about anything\
I've playtested with [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric) and [lambdynamiclights](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights) only, however,\
most other mods shouldn't pose any problems.

## [FABRIC API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) IS REQUIRED!!!
